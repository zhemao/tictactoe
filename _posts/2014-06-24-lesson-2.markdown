Now that you have gotten some familiarity with HTML and CSS, we can start
laying out the game board for our Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. We can create this in HTML using the
HTML `<table>` element.

```html
<table>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
</table>
```

The `<table>` element contains `<tr>` elements, which are the table rows,
and the `<tr>` elements contain `<td>` elements, which are the table cells.

If you just put this in the "index.html" file, you probably won't see anything.
This is because, by default, table cells are not given borders. We can give
borders to our tables using CSS. In the "style.css" file, add a rule like
the following.

```css
td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```

This gives each table cell a solid black border which is 1 pixel in thickness.
Note the unit used here. A pixel is simply a single dot on the monitor.

Note that the selector, "td", does not start with a `#`. That means the rule
does not match based on ID. Instead, it matches based on the element name.
So this will rule will apply to all `<td>` elements on the page.

Another issue is that our table cells are empty, so by default the cells
will have a zero width and height. We can set width and height explicitly
in our CSS rule set.

```css
td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
}
```

Now your table will look something like the following.

<table class="lesson2-table">
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
</table>

Now what does the table look like when you put a X or O in the table cell?

```html
<table>
    <tr><td>O</td><td/><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td>X</td><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
</table>
```

<table class="lesson2-table">
    <tr><td>O</td><td/><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td>X</td><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
</table>

Hmm, not so great. We'd like the X and O to have larger font and be centered.
As we've seen last lesson, we can change the font using the "font-size"
property. The alignment can be changed using the "text-align" property.

```css
table {
    font-size: 24pt;
    text-align: center;
}
```

<table id="lesson2-righttext" class="lesson2-table">
    <tr><td>O</td><td/><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td>X</td><td/></tr>
    <tr><td/><td/><td/></tr>
</table>

Now we have a nice-looking game grid to use. One last thing though, we should
give each cell a unique ID. This will help us when we are coding the game logic.

```html
<table>
    <tr><td id="00"/><td id="01"/><td id="02"/></tr>
    <tr><td id="10"/><td id="11"/><td id="12"/></tr>
    <tr><td id="20"/><td id="21"/><td id="22"/></tr>
</table>
```

If you want to learn more about HTML and CSS, the
[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) has very
good documentation.

Now that we have the HTML and CSS set up, we can move on to writing the
Javascript in the [next lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/06/24/lesson-3.html).
